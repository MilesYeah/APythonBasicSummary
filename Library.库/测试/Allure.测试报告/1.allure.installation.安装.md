# Installing a commandline
Several options for Allure installation are currently supported:

To run commandline application, Java Runtime Environment must be installed.



##  Linux
For debian-based repositories a PPA is provided:
```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:qameta/allure
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install allure
```

##  Mac OS X
For Mas OS, automated installation is available via Homebrew
```
brew install allure
```

##  Windows
For Windows, Allure is available from the Scoop commandline-installer.

To install Allure, download and install Scoop and then execute in the Powershell:
```
scoop install allure
```

Also Scoop is capable of updating Allure distribution installations. To do so navigate to the Scoop installation directory and execute
```

```

This will check for newer versions of Allure, and update the manifest file. Then execute
```
scoop update allure
```

to install a newer version. (documentation)
